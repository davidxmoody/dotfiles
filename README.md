## About

These are my dotfiles. 

This is how I like to customise my system. Feel free to steal anything you like. I wouldn't recommend copying everything but rather just picking and choosing the best bits. 

The `home-setup` script symlinks everything in `dotfiles` to the home directory (and prefixes the filenames with a dot). 

The `bin` directory simply contains a few scripts which were too long or complex for my `bash_aliases` file.
