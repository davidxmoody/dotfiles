# Ideas for things I could do to colorise this:
# - Last file access date, project enter date or commit date
# - File type distribution (mostly ts/tsx or other things)
# - Number of files
# - Number of commits, repo age, number of contributors
# - Hash based on the letters in the name (cyan for things starting with 'c', etc.)
# - Completely custom configurable map
# - Number of commits by me (also take into account number of commits overall)
